      Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I document my learning journey in
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ðŸš€ Here, I share my progress from fundamental
      concepts to fully realized projects. ðŸŽ¯ Each project represents a step in
      mastering the art of coding, and this site serves as my canvas ðŸŽ¨ to
      showcase what Iâ€™ve learned along the way. Come explore and watch as my
      skills continue to evolve! ðŸŒ±
